### What is a ListenerBot?

The listenerbot is targeted for teenagers and college students, who would have a lot of different types of emotional crises and want to talk to somebody. The bot automatically replies to the user's input message. When the user inputs a positive message, the bot automatically saves it into its database. If the user types `good memory`, the bot will pick one of the positive messages in the database and return it to the user.
